Lesson 17

### Iterating over object's keys

Sometimes, we get a reply from a REST API like this:

```js
let translations = {
    de: "Apfel",
    fr: "Pomme",
    tr: "Elma",
    // ... and more translations
}
```

We don't know which keys (translations) exist in the REST API response.

### for...in loop

A `for...in` loop loops over all keys in an object:

```js
let exampleObject = { a: true, b: true, c: false };
for (let key in exampleObject) {
    console.log(key); // prints "a", "b", "c"
    console.log(exampleObject[key]); // prints "true", "true", "false"
}
```

---

### Alternative: Object.keys

* JavaScript has a built in function called `Object.keys()` that returns all the keys of an object:

```js
let exampleObject = { a: true, b: true, c: false };
let exampleKeys = Object.keys(exampleObject);
// exampleKeys is an array: [ 'a', 'b', 'c' ]
```

### Quiz

* What does the following output?

```js
let exampleObject = {
    name: "John",
    address: { 
        city: "Berlin"
    }
}

console.log(Object.keys(exampleObject));
```

`['name', 'address']`

### for...of loop

* Traditionally iterating over an array:

```js
let exampleArray = [ 1, 2, 3 ];
for (let i = 0; i < exampleArray.length; i++) {
    // we have a loop with all the _indexes_ in the array
    // starting at 0, ending at length - 1
    // we access each value of the array using:
    console.log(exampleArray[i]);
}
```

---

### for..of loop

* If we're not interested in the index, just the values of the array:

```js
let exampleArray = [ 1, 2, 3 ];
for (let value of exampleArray) {
    console.log(value); // prints 1 2 3
}
```

* `for...of` only works on arrays (iterables), not on generic objects
